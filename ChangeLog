1.0.1:
    Fix some comparisons with default values, which no longer work in python
    2.7 (as None != "").

1.0.0:
    Allow snapshot and cleanup phases to be skipped on a per-vault basis.

    New major feature: Vaults can transmit their recent snapshots to a
    backup server.

0.5.2:
    Only print success messages if --verbose.

0.5.1:
    Make partial rsync transfers a warning, not an error, so busy files on
	MacOSX won't cause a backup to miss a snapshot.
    Added ChangeLog.

0.5:
    Initial release.
