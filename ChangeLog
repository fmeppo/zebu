    Fix some comparisons with default values, which no longer work in python
    2.7 (as None != "").

    Allow snapshot and cleanup phases to be skipped on a per-vault basis.

    New major feature: Vaults can transmit their recent snapshots to a
    backup server.

    Only print success messages if --verbose.
