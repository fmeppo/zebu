1.2:
    Code cleanup, to reduce the amount of late-night cruft introduced over the
    years.

    Significant speedup, largely due to fetching ZFSfs objects once per object
    (rather than once per object per stage).

1.1:
    Begin tracking child filesystems from run to run, so we can properly
    detect (and propagate) a new filesystem on the sender's side.

1.0.3:
    Bug fix: handle filesystems with spaces in the names (courtesy Rob Rati).

1.0.2:
    Increment minor version, to denote move from SVN to git.  Necessary to
    demark the first tag in git.  Also rebuild the README to use markdown
    for formatting.

1.0.1:
    Fix some comparisons with default values, which no longer work in python
    2.7 (as None != "").

1.0.0:
    Allow snapshot and cleanup phases to be skipped on a per-vault basis.

    New major feature: Vaults can transmit their recent snapshots to a
    backup server.

0.5.2:
    Only print success messages if --verbose.

0.5.1:
    Make partial rsync transfers a warning, not an error, so busy files on
	MacOSX won't cause a backup to miss a snapshot.
    Added ChangeLog.

0.5:
    Initial release.
