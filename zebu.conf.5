.SH NAME
zebu.conf \- configuration file for zebu
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The zebu.conf config file provides information about ZFS filesystems for
zebu to manage.  By default,
.BR zebu
will look in
.I /usr/local/etc/zebu/zebu.conf
followed by
.I /etc/zebu/zebu.conf
for a config file, and use the first file found.
.PP
The file format is rather simple, and follows a layout common to many other
programs' config files.  Lines beginning with a hash (#) are assumed to be
comments.  The file itself is divided into sections, with each section
containing zero or more
.BR key=value
pairs.
.PP
Section names should be on lines by themselves, surrounded by square brackets
(\fB[]\fR).  Each section name is assumed to be a ZFS file system
.BR zebu
should manipulate.



.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
The documentation for
.B zebu.conf
is woefully incomplete.
